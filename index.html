    <h1>Cleo's Pipe</h1>
    <p>Hello there my name is Cleo. What I like to do is make art, make video games and coding.</p>
    <p>
    I did an art project last year that is now called The Spaces Inside. 
    It's starts off with a girl named Parie and boy named Zach they both find each other and decide to work together to stop a cult.
    They then later find that there universes beyond there own and they have to go to these universes in order to save the multiverse.

    I'm currently working on a video game called The Golden Pinecone. 
    It's about a boy named Orion that ran away from home and took a pinecone with him.
    Then he finds out that the pinecone is talking to him and telling him where to go he goes up a mountain and later falls unconscious.
